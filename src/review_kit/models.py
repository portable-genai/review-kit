"""The review-submission payload: the wire shape a producer sends to Hrz7's service intake.

Domain-neutral: it names the maker-checker concepts (action, severity, approvals, segregation
group) but no vertical policy. ``maker`` and ``tenant`` are asserted by the submitting service and
trusted because the service is an authenticated S2S caller (Hrz7 verifies the caller, not the
end user, on this path; per-hop OBO token-exchange is the deferred next layer).
