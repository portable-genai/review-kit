"""The environment has ONE reader, and no read may carry a permissive literal default.

The standing gate for the absence-read-as-consent class, mirroring human-review-console
(``human-review-console/tests/test_profile_single_source.py``): this kit has no
deployment profile to re-derive, so the guard is on the shape the class takes here. The
fail-opens this class produces are spelled ``os.environ.get(name, <literal>)``, the two-state
read that cannot tell "absent" from "set to nothing" and answers both with the literal. One
resolver, ``client._resolve_secret``, owns that decision in three states; a second reader, or
a two-state read reappearing inside it, brings the whole class back.
